              <p align="justify">
                Hello readers! This is my first blog over here. This blog is inspired by a talk given by Mr. Neel Gala, CTO/Co-Founder of InCore Semiconductors. If you have a slight interest in computer architecture, this blog is surely for you. Without making you all more bored let's dive into the topic straightly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>As Architects What do we strive for?</h5>
                <p align="justify">
                    As computer architects, we strive to design and optimize computer systems to meet the ever-increasing demand for computational power and efficiency. We also strive to ensure the security and reliability of computer systems. But at the end of the day what we really desire is to deliver a processor that is optimal for the process in hand. For that purpose we should be able to do Domain Specific computations using customized cores. But don't you think that it will be highly inefficient to build a chip for every program out there :( So what is the best way to tackle this issue? <b>Configurable Cores :)</b>
                </p>
            <br>
            <h5>What are Configurable Cores?</h5>
                <p align="justify"></p>
                Configurable cores refer to the ability to dynamically adjust the number and type of processor cores used for a given task or workload. By allowing the number and type of cores to be adjusted based on the workload, configurable core architectures can optimize resource utilization and reduce power consumption, leading to significant performance gains and cost savings.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Building Configurable Cores</h5>
                <p align="justify">
                <ul>
                    Building a configurable core involves several key elements that are necessary to create a flexible and efficient computing system. Here are some of the important elements:
                    <li style="margin-left: 15px;"><b>Configurable ISAs:</b> Open, Flexible and Modular ISAs like RISC-V along with its rich and diverse ecosystem.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 15px;"><b>Configurable micro-Architecture:</b> Here we aspire to create extremely conﬁgurable, scalable and reusable blocks.</li>
                </ul>
                Ah! too many new terms to digest :( You can lookup through the links given in the right-side panel to get a deeper understanding :) Bear with me. Let's continue with the construction.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    But you cannot build a chip out of every new idea you get as building them costs very much and I am pretty sure you don't wanna get bankrupt just for testing out an idea:) So now what?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Here come core generators and verification generators to the rescue. In short, Core generators are software tools used to create processor cores based on a given instruction set architecture (ISA) such as RISC-V and Verification generators are software tools that help verify the functionality and performance of hardware designs, such as configuration cores.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Finally! done with the specifics of constructing configurable cores. Let's revisit the core idea of configurability.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Core Ideas of Configurability</h5>
                <p align="justify">
                    Configurability is important because it allows systems to be more flexible and adaptable, which can increase their usefulness and extend their lifespan. Some of the core ideas of configurability include:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-left: 15px;">Modularity: Break down a system or component into smaller, independent modules.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 15px;">Parameterization: Use of parameters or variables that can be easily modified to adjust system behavior.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 15px;">Focus on Re-usability from Design and Verification Perspective.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 15px;">Flexibility: To support multiple configurations or variations of a system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p align="justify">
                Configurable cores are a vital element in the design and optimization of computer systems. As computer architects, we strive to deliver processors that are optimal for the task at hand, and configurable cores allow us to achieve this goal by dynamically adjusting the number and type of processor cores used for a given workload. By incorporating key elements such as configurable ISAs and micro-architectures, as well as using core and verification generators, we can create flexible, scalable, and reusable computing systems that are more efficient, cost-effective, and adaptable. The core ideas of configurability, including modularity, parameterization, re-usability, and flexibility, are critical components of this process, enabling us to build systems that are optimized for a variety of different applications and use cases.
